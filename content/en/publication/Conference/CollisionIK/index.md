abstract: "In this work, we present a per-instant pose optimization
method that can generate configurations that achieve
specified pose or motion objectives as best as possible over
a sequence of solutions, while also simultaneously avoiding
collisions with static or dynamic obstacles in the environment.
We cast our method as a multi-objective, non-linear
constrained optimization-based IK problem where each term
in the objective function encodes a particular pose objective.
We demonstrate how to effectively incorporate environment
collision avoidance as a single term in this multi-objective,
optimization-based IK structure, and provide solutions for how
to spatially represent and organize external environments such
that data can be efficiently passed to a real-time, performancecritical
optimization loop. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method by comparing it to various state-of-the-art
methods in a testbed of simulation experiments and discuss
the implications of our work based on our results."
