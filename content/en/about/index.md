I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am working with [Professor Michael Gleicher](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gleicher/) and [Professor Bilge Mutlu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bilge/) on RelaxedIK (Relaxed Inverse Kinematics), an optimization-based framework for generating accurate and feasible robot arm motions in real-time. You can learn more about RelaxedIK [here](https://uwgraphics.github.io/relaxed_ik_core/).

My research interest areas include robotics, machine learning, optimization, computer vision, computer graphics, and potentially more. I'm actively applying to Ph.D. programs this semester.

In my leisure time, I love playing badminton, watching anime, playing [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), playing video games, designing and developing video games.
