I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include robotics, computer vision, machine learning, optimization, computer graphics, and potentially more. I am working with [Professor Michael Gleicher](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gleicher/) and [Professor Bilge Mutlu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bilge/) on several motion planning projects in the [Collaborative Robotics Laboratory](https://robotics.wisc.edu/collaborative-robotics-laboratory/). A large part of my research experience has involved investigating and extending RelaxedIK, a framework previously developed in our lab for generating accurate and feasible robot arm motions in real-time. You can learn more about RelaxedIK [here](https://uwgraphics.github.io/relaxed_ik_core/). In my leisure time, I love playing badminton, watching anime, playing [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), playing video games, designing video games, and developing video games.

I'm applying to graduate schools this semester!
