      <description>I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include robotics, computer vision, machine learning, optimization, computer graphics, and potentially more. I am working with Professor Michael Gleicher and Professor Bilge Mutlu on several motion planning projects in the Collaborative Robotics Laboratory. A large part of my research experience has involved investigating and extending RelaxedIK, a framework previously developed in our lab for generating accurate and feasible robot arm motions in real-time.</description>
