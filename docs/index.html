      <p>I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include robotics, computer vision, machine learning, optimization, computer graphics, and potentially more. I am working with <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gleicher/">Professor Michael Gleicher</a> and <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bilge/">Professor Bilge Mutlu</a> on several motion planning projects in the <a href="https://robotics.wisc.edu/collaborative-robotics-laboratory/">Collaborative Robotics Laboratory</a>. A large part of my research experience has involved investigating and extending RelaxedIK, a framework previously developed in our lab for generating accurate and feasible robot arm motions in real-time. You can learn more about RelaxedIK <a href="https://uwgraphics.github.io/relaxed_ik_core/">here</a>. In my leisure time, I love playing badminton, watching anime, playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>, playing video games, designing video games, and developing video games.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m applying to graduate schools this semester!</p>
